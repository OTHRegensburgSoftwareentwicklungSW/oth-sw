. RESTful paths _MUST_ be intuitive.

.Deployment
. Application _MUST_ be deployed on lab server.
. Application with all its source code and configuration files (but without any binaries) _MUST_ be uploaded to GRIPS as one ZIP file.

.Usage of foreign sources
. Project _MUST_ be realized individually.
. Project _MAY_ re-use some small parts of foreign source code.
  .. If so, the origin of the source code _MUST_ be stated in the comments.
  .. The inclusion of foreign code _MUST NOT_ fulfill essential requirements of the application.
